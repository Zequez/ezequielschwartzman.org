- ## Consultation Call
	- We can meet, explore possibilities, ask questions, gain clarity, draw some sketches, establish priorities and decide next steps.
	- Duration: 45 minutes
	- Free for the first one and for long term supporters; otherwise I ask for a $25 investment.
- ## Live Collaborative Exploration
	- Work side-by-side with me and build something together on a live programming session.
	- Like hiring a creation-ship pilot; you decide where we go next, I drive the spaceship.
		- You can also learn how the spaceship is driven, and drive yourself, if you so desire.
	- Or like hiring a chef to help you cook.
	- I encourage you to contact me beforehand so we establish a general direction of where we'll be going, this is so I can prepare the tools and prep the ingredients before our session, and we can dive right into the juice.
	- Duration: 90min or 3hs sessions
	- Pricing: $50 for short sessions, $100 for long ones
- ## Fixed Project
	- Entrust me to build a system with a finite set of requirements.
		- It can be a remix of something I've done before (such as setting you up with a customized website system)
		- An improvement on an existing system.
		- Or any crazy idea you can think of. If you can imagine it, it can be built.
	- A fixed sum for a set of requirements.
	- Like paying a carpenter to build you a table. A surface, 4 legs, that's it; you can be as specific as you want.
	- Price and time varies by project; better discussed over a consultation call.
- ## Open System Development
	- Entrust me with the development of a system you want to see grow and improve over time. No specific goals, you trust me with the creative direction I take the project. I listen to requests and feedback from investors very carefully.
	- A regular scheduled investment.
	- Like supporting a gardener that nurtures and improves a park over time. Or an experimenter that researches and develop new technologies.
	- You decide how much and often you invest; I prioritize my focus based on which projects are most wanted.
- ## Emotional Healing Process Session
	- I will hold a safe space where we'll journey together into your emotional portals.
	- We'll review the new thoughtmap of feelings and emotions, and I will do my best to assist you in navigating your inner world.
	- Session duration: 90 minutes
	- I'm playing on the Emotional Healing Process Collaboration Team. According to the traditional Gameworld codex, the first 50 EHP are held for free; this applies to me at this moment. So the price is $0.
