- At its best [money is a story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5uGLbV5zVo&embeds_widget_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fbecomemoney.mystrikingly.com%2F&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com&source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&feature=emb_title) we all agree to believe in order to collaborate with other humans at scale.
	- The story goes that a piece of paper or a number on a screen has value, and it can be used to exchange with other things with equivalent value.
- Money is is a [[Patriarchy]] invention. In the Patriarchy [[Gameworld]] whoever has the more money wins and makes the rules; and whoever doesn't, is punished with starving to death. It is of no surprise then that money is a very common source of emotional trauma. If money makes the rules, then you better make sure people are as traumatized about it as possible; that way they will be too scared to question the entire belief system that keeps you in power.
- Humans often forget this is a story, and pieces of colored paper do not really have value.
