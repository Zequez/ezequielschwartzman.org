It's part of the effort towards creating a collaborative web-building platform. A medium sized experiment where I worked
with:
 - Multi-domain system using Vercel's middleware
 - A web-based code editor with an instant preview
 - Data storage and key based authentication using [Atomic Server](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-server)

The overarching goal may take the shape of additional experiments that build up to an usable collaborative web-building system.
