This was initially done as a pure static website project for a client that needed this before/after audio player to showcase his work on his portfolio.

The initial project was done in pure HTML + JS + CSS, and the files were uploaded on Github.

After the work was done we decided to partner up and build a small SASS together. So I added sign up system (using Supabase); file uploading, and player configuration and styling.
