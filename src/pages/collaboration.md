# Collaboration Manifesto

### Possibilities

I offer the possibility of collaborating to co-create:

- Web apps/systems
- Web components to be used in existing sites
- Web browser extensions
- Data scraping systems
- Automation systems
- Anything within my ability

### Service

Creative work is to be written openly and released as open source software, free for everyone
to use and remix, and in service of Gaia, not for profit or manipulating people.

The service looks like forming a team, and holding space for a weekly call for each ongoing
project with other collaborators where we can explore possibilities and decide next steps.
Also shipping of regular updates and reports about the development on the agreed upon
communication channel.

### Time

I don't do well with deadlines, my creative capacity is not linear and often unpredictable,
but a commitment to weekly calls do keep me more consistent, and helps with managing
expectations.

### Money

As for the money to be invested, my request is for it to be interpreted as supporting the
freely given creative development of a public utility as part of a collaborative effort to
create tools that enrich us all, as software cannot be owned, and it is copied at no cost. So
even if I build something initially only for your specific use, it becomes available to
everyone else too at no additional cost.

Software is built in modules, reusable blocks of functionalities that are shared between
projects.

Possible money investment modalities that I resonate with:

- Commitment to moonly support for specific project development
  - Good for nurturing long-term collaboration around a projects
- Commitment to award a completed feature-set or results
  - Good for activating the motivation instincts, and expressing clearly what you want
- Freely given amount as a gift at your own discretion
  - Good for showing appreciation after calls or new releases

Transparency, openness and relaxed playful attitude about financial goals and availability.

Additionally, names and links to the websites of each team collaborator are to be listed on each project.


<!-- Long term, <a href="https://hypha.earth/"
  >there are tools that can be used to creatively collaborate within alternative
  currencies-imbued Gameworlds</a
>, that I would like to explore. Short term, I don't have any money at the moment, and a lot
of availability to create; so I'm looking to pair up with someone who can collaborate
financially. -->
