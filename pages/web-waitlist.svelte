  <h2>How creating on the web works</h2>
  <p>
    Stage 1: It takes 100 hours to create a system so that 1 person can have a
    customized web substrating experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stage 2: It takes another 100 hours to automate the system so it takes only
    15 minutes for the next person to set it up for themselves.
  </p>
  <h2>Here is what I want</h2>
  <p>
    I want to keep creating the Web Environment and developing new substrates
    and digital creative environments for humans.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want people to tell me "Oh Ezequiel I love that thing you built, can you
    build one for me too?" And then I tell them "Oh person, I would love to do
    that, I would probably do it wether you give me money or not, but you know,
    money can come in very handy to buy food and Internet and electricity and
    stuff like that, you know? Would you support me with money so I can continue
    to build all this stuff in the relative comfort of <a href="/land-base"
      >my land base</a
    >? You know, I'm developing this system so it will take like 15 minutes for
    you to set it up; so once it's ready everyone on the waitlist can just
    install it for themselves. Would you like to be on the waitlist?"
  </p>
  <p>
    I think I'm going insane. I'm feel afraid that no on will see this and I'll
    starve to death. Hey Internet! Hey! I'm here! Hey! I'm building something
    here! Would you send people this way please? Thank you!
  </p>
  <p>
    It is said "Build it and they will come". And I say "Build it and never tell
    anyone, and no one will come". This is my survival strategy.
  </p>

  <p>It takes 100 hours to develop a new Substrate for 1 person to use it </p>
  <p
    >It takes 100 hours to develop that Substrate so that 1000 people can use it</p
  >
  <p></p>
  <p> Want a Substrate for you project? </p>
  <p>
    The Web Environment and the Spacious Substrate are already done with Stage
    1. They work for me, but it still requires some advanced technical knowledge
    to use. Documentation, error recovery and cross-platform testing are still
    needed for more people to easily adopt it.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order for that to happen there has to be a neccesity. I'm not about to
    spend 100 hours working on something I don't need and no one wants. I've
    made the mistake in the past of spending a lot of time working on something
    without any feedback from anyone. Not this time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is how creating for the web works: Creating this one website may have
    taken me like 100 hours with all the technology stack combined.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would love it for people to have easily programmed self-soverign spaces on
    the web for their personal mission and projects to share with the world.
  </p><p> </p><p>
    Creating this one website for myself took me a lifetime of incremental
    experimenting and accruing of knowledge. If you know programming, great!
    Clone the repo and you've got it! It may take me 100 hours to create a
    system that empowers people to setup
