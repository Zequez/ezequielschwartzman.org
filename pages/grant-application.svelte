  <h1>Grant Application</h1>
  <p>
    I'm writing this to send to the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/propose/"
      >NLNet foundation commons fund to apply for a grant</a
    >.</p

  <p>
    I'm publishing it here for the sake of getting feedback from collegues
    before I send it, and for applying to other funds if neccesary.

    This form can be used to request support for your project. Note that
    releasing software, hardware and content under libre/open licenses, and the
    application of open standards where possible are transversal requirements
    for all. From our end we will provide a transparent and efficient selection
    process. Please check the (call-specific) guide for applicants for the call
    you are interested in.

  <blockquote>
    Please also don't forget to look into our privacy statement about how we
    deal with your information (should be a pleasant surprise, actually — we
    really care about your privacy. Throughout the years we've funded the
    development of quite some widespread privacy enhancing technologies
    ourselves).

  <blockquote>
    A practical point: we recommend to prepare longer answers offline, in case
    something goes wrong with your browser session. It is a light weight
    procedure, please don't wait until the last hour before the deadline before
    submitting — deadlines are hard.
