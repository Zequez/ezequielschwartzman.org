I'm defining jobs are the things I've done and
    I've been paid for in response to some work done.</p> <h2>Shit picker</h2> <p>When I was a child my father used to pay me and my brother to pick up dog
    shit from the garden. He must have thought this was very clever of him. It
    was. It was a job and I could do it.</p> <p>The payment was for each poop; we would both go with hand shovels and sticks
    and pick up poops and then each individual poop was counted, and payments
    due. There was some nuance about what counted as a complete poop since some
    poops had many parts.</p> <h2>Earth Team... For a banner towing planes businesses</h2> <p>Some friendly neighbours were the owners of a business banner towing planes
    that would mostly fly during the Mar del Plata high season.</p> <p>I was about 14 years old, and I spend a whole summer in the local aeroclub
    hauling, preparing and folding banners, sometimes driving a bike or a car
    into the grassland airstrip.</p> <p>In hindsight it was actually very interesting. In fact I got to fly on a
    plane every day, because I was on the Villa Gesel team, and so we would fly
    every morning there, and come back in the evening. One pilot, Juan, the
    owner son, even did a corkscrew once just for fun; that was exciting. There
    was a lot of downtime in the quiet field, just waiting for the planes. I
    also did some plane-washing, banner painting, mate serving and hangar
    brooming. And I did get once like 20 minutes of actually sitting as co-pilot
    and actually controlling the plane.</p> <p>Additionally, my teammate was from a completely different social background
    from mine; and some things we talked about very shocking; he was a few years
    older than me. I remembered him talking about a friend who was in prision
    for murder, and complete indifference about drinking from the same bottle
    spout, and frightening comments about what he would like to do with women.</p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, the banners are not hanging from the plane from
    the get go, the planes have a kind of rope with a grappling hook and after
    they take off they release the rope, which hangs from the plane, and then
    the banner is layed out in the field with a rope that hangs from 2 post, and
    the plane's gotta fly very low and snatch it in mid-air. The whole process
    is coordinated with a wakie-takie. And when the plane comes back they just
    release the banner mid-air and I was in charge, with a teammate, of picking
    it up, folding it and taking it back to the hangars.</p> <p>I loved to bring it up in conversations about how interesting of a job it
    was.</p> <p>With the money from that I bought my own computer. Prior to that we shared
    one with my brother.</p> <h2>Avalith</h2> <p><a href="https://www.avalith.net/" target="_blank">Avalith</a> still exists
    actually. It's now a software consulting company.</p> <p>At the time I had created the Mapa de Transporte project. And then I was
    "discovered", and offered a job on Avalith because they wanted to create a
    sort of app for Mar del Plata that would include the transport map app that
    I was creating.</p> <p>This was really cool. Someone noticed something I made, and they wanted to
    create something even bigger it! And they wanted my help!</p> <p>Anyway, it turned into a software factory job; they actually already had
    clients, and this idea was a kind of internal project they were trying to
    build; and the attention shifted from it over time; there was no funding or
    money or whatever.</p> <p>I was getting paid regardless,jobs that landed on my workbench, worked with
    new technology, socializing in the office with like-minded tech-people, and
    I actually felt appreciated for what I was capable of. It was really cool to
    have my own money.</p> <p>At the time I didn't much question the hierarchy or the "employment"
    contract agreement. It was just how it was, and I was grateful to be invited
    to play.</p> <p>Since Avalith was kind of a rent-a-programmer scheme, I actually got to be
    onboarded with a US-team and got to travel to San Diego, California for abou
    2 months to work in a corporate office! This was really the cream of my job
    at Avalith. I knew I was being paid very little, but yay! Free international
    traveling? Count me in! I even gotten per-diem, which I saved most of it.
    Bought myself a phone, a laptop and gadgets! And I tried all the fast-food
    chains. And I bought a used bicycle and drove everywhere with a bicycle! I
    drove a trains and took buses! And I met people in the office and there was
    an office kitchen with free hot and cold canned drinks! I got the full
    american corporate job experience! I had lunch breaks where we would even
    drive to certain fast-food chains that my teammates wanted to share with me!
    And once we even went to an electric go-karting place after-office! And I
    got to be in meeting rooms with power point slides every other day! And
    there was one person that would take the tootbrush to the office. And I
    there was one programmer from Italy that only had one hand! And one
    teammate, the team-leader, had this incredible sports japanese car, and he
    was paying US$ 3,000 monthly in rent for his apartment! And I was being paid
    less than US$ 1,000 monthly! He was this very friendly geeky guy much older
    than me that had a blue hoodie.</p> <p>I visited the beautiful Balboa Park and did a lot of hiking! And I lived on
    a Day's Inn the whole time! I even had a bathtub! And there were bagels and
    peanut butter for breakfast! And I was speaking in english with everybody!
    And I was alone in a foreign land!</p> <p>I even had my very own office conflict with someone! It was an accident
    though, about me transgressing his limits, and he being very sensitive to;
    if I recall correctly, I picked his headphones and said something on his
    ear, and he reacted very strongly and there was this huge commottion and
    everybody was watching. I don't even remember what was about, just that I
    didn't expect him reacting like that, it was meant to be something to laugh
    about. Anyway, he apologized afterwards and he drove me to my hotel after
    that day, and we talked in the car, and he mentioned something about
    aspegers, and a motorcycle accident, and he shared with me some Tim Michin
    songs; and I was an ardid atheist at the time, so we bonded over it.</p> <p>Also, during the whole time, I was called Adrian, my second name, because
    there was already an Ezequiel.</p> <p>It was a little bit disenchanting though; surely there were countless social
    gatherings happening; but I was content to spend the weekend evenings just
    playing Civilization 5 on my brand new laptop and eating Subway.</p> <h2>Wube Software</h2> <p>Factorio is a game that is doing a huge service to us humans and Earth. I
    used to want to automate everything, used to long for industrilly automating
    the production of food to make a brighter food for humanity. And automating
    everything with robots for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_Automated_Luxury_Communism">Fully Automated Luxury Communism</a>. Thanks to Factorio, I satisfied all my automation desires without
    incurring any material weight on Gaia. I must have played more than 400
    hours of Factorio, and I even bought the Space expansion, but I was already
    disenchanted from civilization enough that I did't have the will to finish
    it, it just stopped being so interesting for me, as my attention is now on
    cavitating <a href="https://archiarchy.mystrikingly.com/" target="_blank">next culture</a> rather than creating automated technology to free humanity from the evil of
    work.</p> <p>Anyway, the job story with Wube Software, the team behind Factorio, is that
    the system for sharing mods for Factorio was... a forum, and it was just
    very inelegant, and things were hard to find. There were mods that were pure
    gold, but you wouldn't know about them because it was all buried on forum
    posts.</p> <p>So I set myself to make a Factorio Mods portal website. And I added
    functionalities for people to upload mods, download them, upload pictures,
    categories, ratings, stuff like that.</p> <p>I shared it with the community. And it got the attention of the team. And
    they wanted to hire me to make it "official"!</p> <p>You can imagine my joy at hearing this. I didn't even make this proposal,
    THEY ASKED ME. There I was just coding stuff for fun and glory, and someone
    offers me money for what I'm creating!</p> <p>This marked a little bit of a shift from my previous job, because I was like
    a contractor rather than an employee. However what didn't work well for me
    was that they wanted to re-write everything on a different language. See I
    wrote the original portal with Ruby on Rails; and they wanted to write it in
    Python, because they liked Python.</p> <p>The portal was already working, and I was competent in Ruby on Rails; I had
    never written a line of Python in my life. Long story short, the project
    turned dreadful, and I was just doing it for money at the end. The
    development slowed down to a halt, and I had to apologize once and again for
    not delivering what I promised. Then they just cut me off and I was free
    again; or maybe I cut them off. Anyway, they decided to take care of the
    portal internally.</p> <p>I still feel sad about it, I think it could have gone differently. I still
    celebrate the Wube team, for their service in creating Factorio, and I'm sad
    I lost touch with them; they are a truly talented bunch. And there were
    shared values, there was a love for coding itself, and efficiency, and
    elegance, and creating.</p> <p>They did pay me well and it was the first time there was no intermediary
    between me and the client. I even negotiated the rate, and tracked my own
    time and made invoices.</p> <h2>Willdom</h2> <p>This was the rocket fuel for my independance. With this job I moved out of
    my mother house, and got to pay rent for my own apartment, bought a car,
    bought my own food, my own bed with my own sheets, and my own virtual
    reality Oculus Rift headset, and I even had a couch, and sexual experiences,
    and ice cream, and alcohol with friends, and made my own indoor for growing
    marijuana.</p> <p>With the money I also bought a van to turn into a motorhome, which didn't
    work very well (how do I work on building a motorhome from an apartment?).
    And I also managed to make a whole trip to Europe! I visited Barcelona,
    London, Berlin, Prague, Paris and Rome, in about 1 month! This actually was
    very disenchanting, traveling as a tourist was very depressing; I realized
    there that traveling like that wasn't for me; I wanted something different.</p> <p>Regarding the job itself, it was completely absurd. I was onboarded on a
    team that was working on a project about creating a software for making
    Newsletters for real state agents. The Newsletter were written by
    ghostwritters, and then the agents would pay to feed their circle of clients
    with this newsletter software, with custom styles and websites.</p> <p>The job was completely meaningless for me. I got a chance to experience the
    reality of international-tech-working-from-home-job, since this was 100%
    remote, I was paid 100% US dollars, I was earning 100% more than other
    people in my born culture, I was bullshitting my way through reports and
    bending reality so that the work done would look like I had worked 8hs every
    day; which was definitely not the case; but I was asked to always report
    that I worked 8hs, even when I didn't; so I followed orders; yes-sir! The
    company was paid by each hour reported by me, not by each hour worked by me,
    so that was what they cared about, not the truth.</p> <p>The self-pressure of "I should be working" all the time was truly
    wretching. I didn't actually want to do the job, I wanted to play videogames
    and watch anime. And of course I liked the money; anyway I piloted that job
    for a couple of years I think. By the end I was probably just doing about
    3hs of productive work per day, and being paid for 8hs. Honestly, there
    wasn't really enough to do; the "tasks" were rigid with little space for
    just doing whatever I wanted. And I guess I was just getting paid more by
    each hour that I did work; it was like giving myself a rise without asking
    for permission! It's easy to rationalize.</p> <p>Anyway, this put me face to face with the bullshit of how the money earning
    schemes work; I was earning way more money than my culture was telling me
    that I deserved. All in all, I managed to amass an accumulated money of
    about US$ 19,000, which I spent on traveling to Europe the van mostly. In my
    career of money, that was it, I never topped that afterwards.</p> <h2>The Covid Gig</h2> <h2>Ubiquity</h2> <h2>The Before After Audio Player Gig</h2> <h2>Lightningrod Labs</h2> <p>With the money from this I managed to save enough for a plane ticket and
    training fees to get my ass to the April 2025 <a href="https://expandthebox.mystrikingly.com/" target="_blank">Expand the Box</a> in Brasil hosted at the <a href="https://cee.com.vc/" target="_blank">Centro de Experiências Existenciais</a> on Brasil, held by the legendary <a href="https://www.annechloedestremau.org/" target="_blank">Anne-Chloe</a> and <a href="https://www.clintoncallahan.org/" target="_blank">Clinton Callahan</a>.</p> <p>Enough money was leftover to pay for a second Rage Club afterward.</p> <p>There were other ordinary things I did with the money, like providing for my
    son and creating adventures for him.</p> <p>As for the job itself, I assumed I was getting myself into an horizontal
    team, but there were hidden hierarchies, which was obvious in hindsight
    given that one person was paying everbody else in the team.</p> <p>I did enjoy more freedom than in all my previous jobs, and I was celebrated
    for my craft. I didn't quite felt I had a say on the direction of the
    project itself; so it never quite felt like mine. I did have my little
    sandboxed corner within the project boundaries that I could just do whatever
    essentially, so that was really cool. But when I started to notice the
    project was not really going anywhere useful, and I wanted to propose to
    discard everything and just focus on the team itself, and take our skills to
    new directions, that didn't took off. I was honestly more interested in the
    team dynamics than the project, and after the ETB it was just too painful to
    endure the meetings.</p> <p>Survival strategies abounded and I didn not navigate them well. I held on to
    this until I reached the ETB, and then right after I came back, it collapsed
    and never had the will to get any more money from it.</p> <h2>What's next...?</h2> <p>And here I vowed never to sell my soul again for money. And I'm one
    obstinate bastard, enduring the most dreadful poverty somehow knowing there
    must be water on the other side of this. And I sold all my excess material
    possession, which now I see they were my unconscious savings for this very
    purpose, and now I'm lighter than ever.</p> <p>And moved to a cooperative house, Nami house, and co-living with another
    man, another father, and 4 children (intermitently because they spend time
    with their 3 different mothers).</p> <p>And I did some bioconstruction work for a friend where I was given money as
    a gift.</p> <p>And I somehow just keep on surviving, and I somehow keep on eating ice cream
    some times, and I can count on the people that love me. And I still have my
    laptop, and Internet, and electricity, and water, and a roof over my head.</p> <p>And man, if I had known that everything would be alright, that not having
    money would just be an inconvenience rather than a dead sentence, that I
    would still receive money from unsuspecting sources at the right time, then,
    then I would probably have worried a little less.</p> <p>So what now? Now I'm <a href="https://becomemoney.mystrikingly.com/">shifting my context about money</a>. Learning about values. Upgrading my thoughtware. Doing experiments.</p><!----></div><!----><!----></div><!----></div> <div id="nav-start"></div> <div class="print:hidden sticky flex-shrink-0 bottom-0 flexcc overflow-hidden w-full z-99 min-h6"><span class="absolute inset-0 pointer-events-none b-t-1 b-b-1 b-black/20 dark:b-white/50"></span> <a href="#nav-start" class="relative flexcc w-full h-full"><!--[--><span class="size-full relative flexcc font-serif b-t-1 b-b-1 b-black/20 dark:b-white/50 bg-gray-200 text-gray-600 text-shadow-[0_1px_0_#fff] dark:bg-gray-800! dark:text-gray-300! dark:text-shadow-[0_1px_0_#000]"><span class="block relative"><span class="absolute block top-10% right-100% mr1 h-80% opacity-20 dark:filter-invert"><img src="/assets/guarda-BNASqf_P.svg" class="h-full max-w-none" alt="Intricate design on left of name"></span> Ezequiel Adrian Schwartzman <span class="absolute block top-10% left-100% ml1 h-80% scale-x-[-1] opacity-20 dark:filter-invert"><img src="/assets/guarda-BNASqf_P.svg" class="h-full max-w-none" alt="Intricate design on right of name"></span></span></span><!----><!--]--></a></div><!----> <!--[--><div class="relative print:hidden flex-grow"><!--[--><div class="absolute inset-0 z-9"><div class="w-full h-full bg-slate-600 dark:bg-slate-800" style="background-image: url(/assets/noise-abstract-DN0TOv74.png)"></div><!----></div><!--]--> <div class="relative z-10"><!--[!--><!--]--></div></div><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!----></div><!--]--></div>
