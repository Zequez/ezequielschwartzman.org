# Personal [Gameworld](#gameworld)

You don't get to tell me what I create or how. You are welcome to inspire
me to take action with outrageous proposals. What I create and how I do it
it's for my own delight.

I only sell one thing. It's credits for my [Presencial Service](#presencial-service).
You can buy them and schedule meetings with me. What I create is a service
for everybody, not for you in particular.

You are welcome to buy a lifetime worth of meetings with me, and you can
schedule them at your leisure by using the [Calendar Link](#calendar-link). No more than
once or twice per week. You may also use the Calendar Link to join
group-sized Presencial Service offerings that I publish. You can stay in
touch with my offerings by subscribing on my [Presence Link](#presence-link).

You can see your credits with me on the [Credits Link](#credits-link). You may buy credits
with any currency and form of material and non-material value. There is a
credits vending machine at the Protocols Link. For negotiation PM me.
Mutual Credit is an option. And there is still plenty of spaces on my EHP
training credits line. If we haven't met each other make sure to contact
me before scheduling on the Calendar Link.

You can find the most effective protocols for contacting me at my
[Protocols Link](#protocols-link).
