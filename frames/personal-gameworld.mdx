# Personal [Gameworld](#gameworld)

You don't get to tell me what I create or how. You are welcome to inspire
me to take action with outrageous proposals. What I create and how I do it
it's for my own delight.

I only sell one thing. It's credits for my [Presencial Service](#presencial-service).
You can buy them and schedule meetings with me. What I create is a service
for everybody, not for you in particular.

You are welcome to buy a lifetime worth of meetings with me, and you can
schedule them at your leisure by using the [Calendar Link](#scheduler). No more than
once or twice per week. You may also use the Calendar Link to join
group-sized Presencial Service offerings that I publish. You can stay in
touch with my offerings by subscribing on my [Presence Link](#presence).

You can see your credits with me on the [Credits Link](#credits). You may buy credits
with any currency and form of material and non-material value. There is a
credits vending machine at the Protocols Link. For negotiation PM me.
Mutual Credit is an option. And there is still plenty of spaces on my EHP
training credits line. If we haven't met each other make sure to contact
me before scheduling on the Calendar Link.

You can find the most effective protocols for contacting me at my
[Protocols Link](#protocols).


# Personal Gameworld

1. I'm on team Gaia.
2. I don't create things in exchange for money.
3. If you are on my team I'll be glad to create something that supports your own work.
4. If you want to support my work, evolutionary path and personal growth, you may buy credits from me
   for my automatic 80min video-call meetings scheduler. You are welcome to negotiate with me and buy as many as you want.
5. There is no fixed exchange rate for credits. Just make me a sensible proposal that would work for you.
6. You may also show your commitment to me by committing to buy credits on a regular basis. By doing so, you'll be
   welcome to use the automatic scheduler regardless of how many credits are on your name; you can go into negatives.
7. If there are credits to your name, you may give them to another person by asking me.
8. You may check all the credits issued on my system at on the [Credits](#credits) link.
9. I'm open to manually negotiate meeting with you on other times outside the automatic scheduler slots.
10.  Any scheduled call without contacting me beforehand presenting yourself will be automatically canceled. The purpose
     of the scheduler is to make it easier for you to meet with me; make sure I'm willing to meet with you first.
