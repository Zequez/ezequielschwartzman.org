# Money

I'm going to give some rough guidelines.

I've decided that the money is not mine until I use it, and that the money I have floating around me
it's just money I'm transporting to somewhere else. This story works for me.

The money becomes mine when I use it because I'm pointing it into a direction, release it, and it
creates ripples in the world; I own the results I create with my use of money.

I am a money magnet.
