# Startover Game

At [Startover.xyz](http://startover.xyz/), it's a network of interconnected websites originated by Clinton Callahan with
the purpose of upgrading human thoughtware around the world with radical
knowledge obtained on the Possibility Management Gameworld.

Each page holds new distinctions and experiments to land these distinctions
on your bodies.

As you do the experiments you are invited to log the Matrix points from doing them
along with some kind of proof. The part of logging the Matrix points does not work for
me (because I find it dull, clunky and pointless). But the part of being a homungous
(and I mean more than 500 pages homungus) repository
of radical paradigm shifting knowledge is extremely valuable and engaging. The first time
I discovered the Startover websites I became obsessed and stayed until morning reading
with a ridiculous number of opened tabs.

It's like finding a doorway to a wizards Wikipedia that it's actually humans from the
future that came back in time to teach you all about your untapped human powers.

As I see it, it's a huge doorway to archan culture.
