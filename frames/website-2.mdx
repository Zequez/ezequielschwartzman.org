# Setup an environment

This is made of 2 parts. One it's something I'm calling [The Web Environment](https://github.com/zequez/web-environment) and then
there is [my personal website](https://github.com/zequez/ezequielschwartzman.org) that is mounted into the web environment. I developed most stuff on the website
level, and I'll be shifting it to the environment level as I mature it.

At the current state it's custom made for myself and I have not tested the environment except on my personal computer, so it's
likely the process to set it up for yourself won't be very smooth.

I'm offering my services to guide you through the early process of setting this up, through all the complexities.
It's not intentionally complex, it's just that I made it for myself; it will get easier as more people use it and I gain clarity on
what is needed; so that's where you come in. I cannot do this alone.

Let's make a deal; I've got some [Money Containers](#money-containers) that need refilling, you can support me by sending some money my way so that the containers are refilled.

And I'll give you virtual credits for my automatic scheduler; so you can schedule meetings with me at your leisure.

You can check where I am at with money, my paradigms, ongoing research and what I'll be doing with the money in the [money](#money) link.
