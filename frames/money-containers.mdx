# Energetic Money Containers

An Energetic Money Container is a container that you declare for yourself and it just floats around you
and magnetizes money towards you. You declare the rules for the container, and you commit to the rules. That's it.

Here are the two containers I'm holding right now

## The Ordinary Patriarchy Surfing And Land Steward Container

Sure, I could move into the middle of nowhere, and grow my own food, make my own clothes, and forget about money forever.

But what I truly want is choice, with an empty Ordinary Container the choices become limited,
sure, I can live under a bridge or couchsurf with friends and family, or try and negotiate without money.

Look, I'm down to sleep under a bridge for the unique life experience, AND I also want to steward a home,
keep a camp filled with food for travelers, and for my son, and give back to the land, sourcing from the
abundance of resources created by the collective money-playing folks.

This is also money to feed my Gremlin with the little pleasures of life, like chocolate and going to the trampoline park with my son.

This is the container that keeps my Box purring like a kitten.

What the money of this container is *NOT* for:

- Gambling
- Corporations when there is a non-corporate alternative to the resource
- Pesticide ridden food, when there is an agroecologic earth-regenerative alternative
- Plane tickets
- Buying a car
- New gear
- For trainings, for workshops, for traveling expenses and accomodations for trainings, for coaching, therapy, ceremonies, initiations and transformation

This is a very spongy container, so when it's not fully filled it absorbs all the money instantly, leaving
nothing for the other containers. A healthy Ordinary Container is well saturated with money, like a moist cake.

Current container capacity US$ 1000

## The Extraordinary

How is this container filled. Well when the Ordinary container is well saturated, this one get's filled quite quickly.
Additionally, a property of this container is that the capacity is very precise, based on my upcoming trainings.

Current capacity is US$ 2000 for the upcoming ETB, Labs, Fear Club and Gremlin Transformation trainings.

This is the container that turns me on.

## The Gear Up Container

This container is to be clarified on another time...
