# This is not a website

This is a projection of a fully customizable web-publishable creative environment system that I created and use for my own personal delight.

It's developing, growing and evolving on my computer and it generates an optimized web-projection.

It's a tool for sharing my ongoing research with the world, it's my own personal Gameworld digital sandbox gameboard,
and to take a stand for this is part of my [Gameplan](https://yourgameplan.mystrikingly.com/)

It's built upon the principles of radical collaboration and experimentation. It's an evolving [Gameworld](#gameworld) you can play on.

It does not have a "production" version and it will never have, it's meant
to be used in development mode by everybody who uses it, you get updates directly from the code repository as I publish them.

It's an invitation to collaborate on a planetary level to create the radically collaborative open digital
infrastructure of [Archiarchy](#archiarchy) in service of [Gaia](#gaia).
